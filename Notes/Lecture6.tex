\begin{itemize}

  \item Olber's Paradox: Why is the Sky Dark?

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Absorbing Matter $\to$ doesn't work since matter would heat up

      \item Finite Size

      \item Finite Time (and Finite Speed of Light)

      \item Dimming of Light (``redshift'')

    \end{itemize}

  \item Universe had some beginning (``Big Bang'') around 13.7 billion years ago

  \item Some units:

    $$1[\text{light year}]=9.5\cdot10^{15}[\si{\meter}]$$
    $$1[\text{yr}]\approx \pi\cdot10^{7}[\si{\second}]$$
    $$c\approx 3\cdot10^8\left[ \si{\meter\over\second} \right]$$
    $$1[\si{\parsec}]=3.26[\text{light years}]$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item If $\theta=1[\text{arcsec}]$, then $d=1[\si{\parsec}]$

        $$1[\si{\parsec}]=2.1\cdot10^5[\text{AU}]$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Cosmological Principle

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Copernicus: the Sun, not the Earth, is the center of the Universe

      \item Cosmological Principle: There is no center to the Universe

        \begin{itemize}

          \item The Universe is statistically isotropic (same in all directions) and homogenous (same everywhere)

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Expanding Universe

    \begin{itemize}
        
      \item All observers see things moving away from them

      \item Statements are all statistical! Distinguish between structure in the universe and the geometry of the homogenous universe (about 100$[\si{\mega\parsec}]$ scales for homogeneity)

      \item We don't experience the FLRW metric

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Homogenous/geometry

          \item Structure

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
