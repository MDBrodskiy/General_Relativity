  \item Metric $\to$ measuring things (``meter'')

  \item In differential geometry, a metric defines how we calculate distance

    $$\Delta s^2=-\Delta t^2+\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2+\Delta z^2\,\quad\text{ (the metric in Minkowski space)}$$
    $$=\eta_{\mu\nu}\Delta x^{\mu}\Delta x^{\nu}\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A repeated index (up and down) $\to$ sum

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Greek: 0-3

            $$\begin{array}{l r} \Delta x^{\mu} & \Delta x^0\\ & \Delta x^1\\ & \Delta x^2\\ & \Delta x^3\end{array}$$

          \item Latin: 1-3

            $$\begin{array}{l r} \Delta x^{i} & \Delta x^1\\ & \Delta x^2\\ & \Delta x^3\end{array}$$

        \end{itemize}

        $$\eta_{00}\Delta x^0\Delta x^0+\eta_{01}\Delta x^0\Delta x^1+\eta_{02}\Delta x^0\Delta x^2+\eta_{10}\Delta x^1\Delta x^0+\eta_{11}\Delta x^1\Delta x^1+\cdots$$

      \item This can be written as:

        $$\eta_{\mu\nu}=\left( \begin{array}{c c c c} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\ \end{array}\right)$$
        $$=\eta_{00}\Delta x^0\Delta x^0+=\eta_{11}\Delta x^1\Delta x^1+=\eta_{22}\Delta x^2\Delta x^2+=\eta_{33}\Delta x^3\Delta x^3$$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
